The idea was to create an app that would work like a pokedex giving us the information that we wanted to know about such pokemon, between the 5 sections available:

Home Page: Where you select the Pokemon you want to search.

Abilities: Where we can see witch abilitys can the pokemon have.

Moves: Has every move that either the pokemon can learn on his own or be taugth, along with the moves details.

Stats: Show the base stats that pokemon has.

Cries: Where you can ear how every pokemon communicates.

This was a project made in the Code For All bootcamp, where the objetive was to learn how to use Spa and to use API's.

Current Objetives are to make the website better looking using CSS.
